        <p>I canâ€™t remember a time when I was not fascinated by the world of robotics. 
            After years of building electronics projects in my garage and participating in local competitive robotics in middle school, 
            I jumped at the opportunity of starting a VEX Robotics Competition team with my friends when I started High School. 
            Our team has competed as VRC Team 9217A (9th grade) and 8332D (10th and 11th), and advanced to State and National Level Competitons.

                <p>During our first year of participating in the VEX Robotics Competition and under the mentorship of team 8332A, 
                    our team (then under the name Oat) was awarded the Judges award at our first competition in Austin, Texas, and made numerous appearances in elimination matches.
