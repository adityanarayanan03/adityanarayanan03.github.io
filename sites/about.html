        <p class='text text_chunk' id="tldr"><span class="boxed_header">TLDR:</span> I'm a junior at the <span style="background-color:#B84D00; color: white; padding-left: 5px; padding-right: 5px; border-radius: 5px;">University of Texas at Austin ðŸ¤˜</span> where I study computer engineering.
            My dream is to be a robotics engineer, building robots that work together with humans for society's benefit.

        <p class='text text_chunk' id="full_version"><span class="boxed_header">The full version:</span> My name is Aditya Narayanan (UT ECE '25). 
                        I grew up in College Station, Texas, where I graduated from College Station High School in 2021. I've always been a maker, and that's because being a maker
                        is all about solving problems in creative ways. I was super into competition robotics in high school, as designing and building complex robotic systems
                        to solve new and interesting problems was thrilling. I spent the past summer as an Engineering Development Intern at Mathworks in Massachussetts. I currently work 
                        in the UT Austin Swarm Robotics Lab, where I research networked edge-robotics.

            <p class="text"> <span class="boxed_header">Academic Interests:</span> Simply put, my academic interests are robotics. That's broad, but I've enjoyed projects and courses ranging anywhere 
                from networked robotics to edge-ML to quantum information. In the future, I hope to focus on networked Edge-ML with robotics applications.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                With few exceptions, I've enjoyed all the math and engineering courses I've taken, but some I've really loved. My favorite 
                courses to date are by far Computer Vision &#x1F440;, Operating Systems, and Data Science. Unconventional computation and Quantum Information Science earn honorable mentions.

                really love the process of learning and performing classical music as well as appreciate that playing violin gives me a place to 
                express an artistic side of me.

                I enjoy playing most sports, but I am by far the most passionate about tennis &#x1F3BE;. I play with UT's club tennis team, where we compete in
