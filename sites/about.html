        <p class='text'><span style='color:#03dac5'>TLDR:</span> I'm a Freshman at the University of Texas at Austin studying Electrical and Computer Engineering.
                        I'm a problem solver that loves building and making and my dream is to be a robotics engineer, building robots that work with humans for society's benefit.</p>
        <p class='text'><span style='color:#03dac5'>The full version:</span> My name is Aditya Narayanan and I'm studying electrical and computer engineering (ECE) at UT Austin. 
                        I'm originally from College Station, Texas, and I graduated from College Station High School in 2021. I've always been a maker, and that's because being a maker
                        is all about solving problems in creative ways. I got into competition robotics in high school, as designing and building complex robotic systems
                        to solve new and interesting problems was absolutely thrilling. In college, I love attending hackathons to replicate the thrill I felt competing in robotics
                        in high school. During high school, I spent every summer in Electrical Engineering or Mechanical Engineering
                        research labs at Texas A&M University, where I got to apply my engineering problem-solving skills to real world, modern problems. I currently work in the 
                        Swarm Robotics Lab at UT Austin, where I research computer vision on single board computers. </p>
