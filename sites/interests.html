            <h2>Academic Interests</h2>
            <p>Simply put, my academic interests are robotics. If that sounds broad, that's because I haven't committed to specialization yet. 
                I've worked on projects focusing on Networked Robotics, Computer Vision, Controls, and even Blockchain, and enjoyed them all. 
                One thing I can say regardless of what topic I'm working on, is: I build systems. Regardless of if it's Networked Robotics or 
                Controls, I am dedicated to combining theory with efficient implementations.
            </p>
            <p>
                With few exceptions, I've enjoyed all the math and engineering courses I've taken, but some I've really loved. My favorite 
                courses to date are by far Computer Vision and Operating Systems. Following closesly are Algorithms and Unconventional Computation (especially 
                the part about analog computation).

            <h2>Non-academic Interests</h2>
                <p>I play the violin, and am currently a violinist in the UT University Orchestra. I started playing violin when I was 5, and grew to 
                    really love the process of learning and performing classical music as well as appreciate that playing violin gives me a place to 
                    express an artistic side of me.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I enjoy playing most sports, but I am by far the most passionate about tennis. I play with UT's club tennis team, where we compete in 
                    USTA Tennis-on-campus tournaments around Texas.
